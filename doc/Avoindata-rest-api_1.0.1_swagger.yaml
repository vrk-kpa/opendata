  description: "Simple API to manage open data sets in avoindata.fi\n\n# Important\
    \ note\nThis is not a traditional rest API in the strict sense. **It does not\
    \ use PUT or DELETE http methods**. Instead, it does everything with GET or POST\
    \ methods. This means that the color coding in the (swagger) documentation is\
    \ misleading. \n\n# Open and limited access functions \n\nFunctions which can\
    \ be used **without authorization are grouped under _consumers_**. \nSome API\
    \ functions **require authorization (grouped under _admins_)**. With these methods\
    \ you will need API key provided by CKAN system. \n\n**In every API call you need\
    \ to provide APInf platform specific API-key**. You can get that by creating account.\
    \ After logging in, your API key is visible in every API profile page (top right\
    \ corner). \n<center>\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bEGmr2s.png)\n</center>\n\n\
    # A few simple examples\n\n**Simple example to list datasets** is: \n\n``curl\
    \ -X GET \"https://kokeilu.apinf.io:3002/avoindatabeta/package_list\" -H  \"X-API-Key:\
    \ YOUR APINF API KEY\"`` \n\nwhich returns JSON formatted list of datasets.\n\n\
    **Simple example to view details of one dataset** is:\n\n``curl -X GET \"https://kokeilu.apinf.io:3002/avoindatabeta/package_show?id=digiroad\"\
    \ -H  \"X-API-Key: YOUR APINF API KEY\"``\n\nwhich returns JSON formatted detailed\
    \ infomation about identified dataset.\n\n\n# Authentication and API keys\n\n\
    There's two kind of keys: \n- **X-API-Key**. APInf Platform API key used in analytics.\
    \ This required in all API calls. You can get that by creating account. After\
    \ logging in, your API key is visible in every API profile page (right top corner).\
    \ \n- **Authorization**. To authorize user to do admin operations in CKAN system.\
    \ This key can be obtained by signing up to https://beta.avoindata.fi. \n\nSome\
    \ API functions require authorization (grouped under _admins_). The API uses the\
    \ same authorization functions and configuration as the web interface, so if a\
    \ user is authorized to do something in the web interface they’ll be authorized\
    \ to do it via the API as well.\n\nWhen calling an API function that requires\
    \ authorization, you must authenticate yourself by providing your API key with\
    \ your HTTP request. To find your API key, login to the CKAN site using its web\
    \ interface and visit your user profile page. In SwaggerUI, you need to input\
    \ CKAN authorization API-key to _Authorization_ value field. Open authentication\
    \ dialog by clicking _Authorize_ button.\n\n# Datamodels\n\nAll datamodels used\
    \ are defined in separate service. LINKS HERE!\n"
